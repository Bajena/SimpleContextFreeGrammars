<h1><tt>JavaCFG</tt> - Installation and Usage</h1>

<p>
<ol>
  
  <li>After unzipping or gunzipping and untar'ing, a
  directory called "<tt>JavaCFG</tt>" will be created,
  and you should <tt>cd</tt> into it.

  <li>Create the Java bytecode with the command
  
<blockquote><tt>
javac CFGParse.java
</tt></blockquote>

  <li><a href="#grammarfiles">Write a grammar file</a> such as
  <a href="grammars/acer-pals.cfg">the racecar grammar</a>
  or sample from some examples provided in the
  <a href="grammars">grammars directory</a>.

  <li>attempt to parse an <i><tt>input-string</tt></i>
	with the command
<blockquote>
  <tt>java CFGParse <i>grammar-file-path input-string</i></tt>
</blockquote>

<li>if <i><tt>input-string</tt></i> is generated by the grammar,
	two trees are created:
<ul>
<li>the first tree is represented by a file system style tree
	that is viewable and clickable in a Java window.
	Directory icons (<img align="center" src="variableIcon.gif">) 
	represent variables in the grammar,
  while file icons  (<img align="center" src="terminalIcon.gif">) 
represent terminals.  You can see which
  productions were used in the derivation tree by opening
  up the directories to reveal the right hand side of the
  corresponding production.
<li>the second tree is represented by a LaTeX file called
	"<tt><i>input-string</i>.tex</tt>" which contains information
	for drawing the derivation tree in a more standard fashion
	than the first representation
</ul>

<li>if <i><tt>input-string</tt></i> is not generated by the grammar
	this fact is reported in a window created by the program.  No
	LaTeX file is created in this case.

  <li>If you want convert the LaTeX tree into PDF
  you'll need LaTeX installed. The command
  <blockquote> <tt>pdflatex <i>filename</i>.tex </tt>
  </blockquote>
	creates a file called "<tt><i>filename</i>.pdf</tt>"
	which contains a picture of the derivation tree.
</ol>
</p>

<a name="grammarfiles"><h2>Grammar Files</h2></a>

  <p>
  Grammars are stored as text files
   which should end with the <tt>.cfg</tt> extension.  They are
   specified as follows:

  <ul>

          <li>  Each line consists of white-space separated strings which represent 
				  productions from a common variable
          <li>  The first string of any line must have length 1 and is a variable
          <li>  Subsequent strings on a given line are the right hand sides
                 of productions from the variable for that line
          <li>  The first variable on the first line is the start variable
          <li>  Any character which isn't a variable, is a terminal
			<li> <i>THE FOLLOWING IS NOT RECOMMENDED (EARLEY'S PARSING ALGORITHM MAKES
					NO GUARANTEES ABOUT EPSILONS)</i>:
					A single double-quote symbol " represents the empty
                 string &epsilon;
                 (we think of " as two single quotes with nothing in between)
          
  </ul>
  
       For example the language
<blockquote>
 {<i>a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup></i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>n</i> > 0} 
&cup;
 {<i>b<sup>n</sup>a<sup>n</sup></i> &nbsp; | &nbsp; <i>n</i> > 0} 
</blockquote>
has the context free grammar:
<pre>
S &rarr; X | Y
X &rarr; aXb | ab
Y &rarr; bYa | ba
</pre>
which is represented in the grammar file by:
<pre>
S X Y
X aXb ab
Y bYa ba
</pre>

<h2>Directory Structure and Source Code</h2>

After untaring or unzipping you will find the following files
<dl>
<dt>CFG.java</dt>
<dd>	     A class the defines the context free grammar object used by JavaCFG.  
			Embedded in this class is some additional functionality,
			added by <a href="http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~zeph/software/YoavHircsh">
			Yoav Hirsch</a> for de-epsilonizing, and converting grammars into 
			Chomsky Normal Form.   Instructions for how to call on the conversion
			algorithms is embedded in the file.
</dd>		     
<dt>CFGParse.java	<dt>     
<dd>A class created for simplifying the parsing command.</dd>

<dt>EarleyAgent.java</dt>
<dd>     A class used in the parsing algorithm.</dd>

<dt>EarleyRule.java</dt>	     <dd>A class used in the parsing algorithm</dd>


<dt>MalformedGrammarException.java</dt>
<dd>
		     An exception class used to let the user
		     know that their grammar has not been
		     defined properly, has a typo, or 
		     is not the right type for the given operation.
</dd>
<dt>Rule.java</dt>	     
<dd>A class which defines the productions of a CFG.</dd>

<dt>TreeModel2LaTeX.java</dt> 
<dd>A class for converting JTree objects into LaTeX
		     						trees.
</dd>

<dt>grammars</dt>	
<dd>     A directory containing some examples of grammars
		     NOTE: some of these grammars contain epsilons
		     and that the success of the parsing algorithm
		     on such grammars is not guaranteed.
